Find two numbers whose difference is 5. (independent, support: [\"one number is 5 less than another number\"])\nnum1, num2 = map(int, sorted(list(set([x for x in range(35) if 35 - x == 5])))[::-1])\n\n# 2. Find the other three numbers. (depends on 1, support: [\"The sum of five numbers is 35\"])\nnum3 = 35 - num1 - num2\nnum4 = 35 - num1 - num2 - num3\nnum5 = 35 - sum([num1, num2, num3, num4])\n\n# 3. Final Answer: Find the numbers if one number is 5 less than another number. (depends on 2, support: [])\nprint(f\"The numbers are: {[num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]}\")\nanswer = None  # Since the final answer is printed directly in the code, no need for an explicit variable.</s>"]}
