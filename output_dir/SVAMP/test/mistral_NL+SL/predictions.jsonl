The final answer, however, is still the same as the intended answer (51 dollars). The given answer was mistakenly included in the question. To correct the problem, we need to revise the calculation of \"money\\_left\" to be 71 dollars instead of 26 dollars and adjust the calculation for the money spent at the supermarket from that value.\n# Revised code for the calculation:\n\n# 1. How much money was there initially in Olivia's wallet? (independent, support: [\"There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet\"])\nmoney_initial = 106\n# 2. How much money did Olivia spend at the showroom? (independent, support: [\"She spent 49 dollars at the showroom\"])\nmoney_showroom = 49\n# 3. How much money was left in Olivia's wallet after the showroom? (depends on 1 and 2, support: [])\nmoney_left = money_initial - money_showroom\n# 4. How much money did Olivia spend at the supermarket? (depends on 3, support: [\"There were 51 dollars left after the showroom\"])\nmoney_supermarket = money_left\n# 5. Final Answer: How much money did Olivia spend at the supermarket?
