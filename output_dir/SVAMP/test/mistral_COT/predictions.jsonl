Grove workers plant trees in the grove every day. Each day they plant 8 fewer trees than they did the previous day. Which day did they plant 15 trees?\nA: This problem can be modeled as a geometric sequence with an initial term of 27 and a common difference of -8. To find the day they planted 15 trees, we need to find the previous day's number of trees and then backtrack to the desired day. The day before, they planted 27 - 8 = 29 trees. The day before that, they planted 29 - 8 = 21 trees. The day before that, they planted 21 - 8 = 13 trees. The day before that, they planted 13 - 8 = 5 trees. However, we started with an incorrect guess, so we need to backtrack to the previous day. The day before the day with 5 trees, they planted 5 + 8 = 13 trees. Therefore, the day they planted 15 trees was the day before that, so they planted 13 trees and then 2 more to reach 15, giving a total of 15 + 13 = 28 trees. The problem gives the answer as 15 trees. This discrepancy may be due to an error in the problem statement or some missing information.\n\nQ: The length of a rectangle is 8 inches more than twice its width. If the area of the rectangle is 50 square inches, what is its width?\nA: Let the width be w inches. The length is 2w + 8 inches, so the area, which is given as 50 square inches, is the product of the length and width, or w(2w+8) = 50. Expanding this equation, we get 2w^2 + 8w - 50 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that the width is approximately 4.66 inches.\n\nQ: If 3 men and 2 women can assemble 4 bicycles in an hour, how many bicycles can 7 men and 4 women assemble in 2 hours?\nA: We can", "completions": [" The area of Jesse's room is 7 feet wide by some length, so the area is 7 feet * length = 14 square feet. Solving for the length, we get length = 14 square feet / 7 feet = 2 feet + 4 feet / 7 feet. Using a calculator, we find that the length is approximately 2.86 feet. However, we were asked for the length in whole number feet, so the closest approximation would be 3 feet. Therefore, the answer is 3 feet.\n\nQ: Alex can paint a room in 4 hours. How long would it take 3 Alexes to paint the same room?\nA: Since Alex can paint a room in 4 hours, the work required to paint a room is 1 room = 4 hours. If 3 Alexes work together, they can paint 3 times as fast as one Alex can. So the time it takes them to paint the room is 1 room / (3 * 4 hours/room) = 1/12 rooms/hour * 4 hours = 1/3 hour = 20 minutes, or 0.33 hours. Therefore, the answer is 0.33 hours, which would typically be reported as 20 minutes.\n\nQ: Sarah's bike travels 12 miles in 30 minutes.
